# Easy training

Easy training is a website that should support the person who has a motivation to start exercise but dosen´t knows where to start. You maybe never have been on a gym, or never trained at all, and for that target group, this website makes it possible to sign up so you can get access to a gallery with several vdeor, and information that will support a better health, and to actually start training!

## Features 

On my website there is a Home page where I immediately catch the user's attention with the help of starting training. I explain the why´s, how´s and some brief action measures what membership can bring the user for benefits in the long run.

### Existing Features
__Navigation Bar__
- [Landing Page](https://saram88.github.io/Project-1/)

__The landing page image__

On my landing page, I have posted a photo that directly creates contact with the user. That we mean business and that we can really help to get the training done.

## Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea is to build a community that users can meet other people. Many personal trainers have that today but you need to pay for it, here you can share good idéas to each other at a much lower cost.



## Testing 

I've test-driven the page on validering.w3.org for both my html code and ccs styling. In addition to that, I have tested myself via browser tools for validation. Also have to test on my two different cell phone varieties as well as an ipad.

Also from the webpage i test it in this order:

1. Open my reprositary in webpage
2. open inspect 
3. Open design to watch my homepage in different size 




## Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2F5500-saram88-helaminfullatam-fq2y2b0nxao.ws-eu90.gitpod.io%2Fassets%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2F5500-saram88-helaminfullatam-fq2y2b0nxao.ws-eu90.gitpod.io%2Fassets%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=sv)

## Unfixed Bugs

- Better design for other devices.

- I change the size of the movies to better UX when looking on a mobilephone 

- I fixed my menu so it center of my first homepage picture insted

- I change the content so the readibillity gets better( UX ) 


## Deployment

When I was inside my project, I went to the little tab called "Settings". From here I pressed the small sidebar and then "Pages". Here I found the heading "Branch" where you should choose "main" as your branch
